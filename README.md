# InvestmentCalculator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.11. I have since updated it to be able to run Angular version 19, which allows me to use the newer signals features that act
as a replacement for the @Input tags.

The purpose of this project is to build my own understanding of frontend frameworks, notably Angular, and get used to structuring components in an easily readable way for future development should anyone else come across it.
I plan to come back to this project every now and again to refine the code and other pieces of my frontend development that I am a bit rusty on, for instance my CSS skills.

The project idea is simple: using a base amount of money, an Annual Percentage Yield, and total years, output a table to the user displaying how much money they would accrue with interest over the set duration of time

Note that this is only a frontend project, however it could potentially be expanded to include backend capabilities as you can call a microservice to do the calculations and return the necessary array. I didn't think that would be a great use of time since I want to get an understanding of frontend technologies first, but it's not a bad idea in the future to implement this to get an understanding of connecting backend to the frontend

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
